# GRIT
Repo that holds our project, Grit for the All Womens Virtual Hackathon 2021. 

The motivation behind Grit is, to help women grow in their careers by defining career goals, defining ways to achieve those goals, tracking their progress/career milestones, and connecting them with women who have similar goals so that they can support each other to achieving their goals.


## Running locally

First, clone the repo: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmatson93/womens-hackathon-2021.git 
```
Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install 
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
